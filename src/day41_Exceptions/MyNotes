Exceptions Topic:
    1. Unchecked vs checked
    2. try & catch blocks
    3. Multi-catch block
    4. finally block
    5. throws keyword
    6. throw keyword

  ##  checked Exceptions:
    exceptions that are checked at *compile time*
    occurs during the *compile time*
    code will not compile if we do not handle them
    they do not* have IS A relationship with RuntimeException class

    un-checked Exceptions:
        exceptions that are checked at runtime
        occurs during the *runtime
        code *will compile* even if we do not handle them
        they do *have IS A relationship with RuntimeException class

OutOfMemoryError: heap memory is full


Exceptions: unexpected or unwanted events
   # unchecked(unexpected event): occurs during the runtime  (Runtime Exception)
        all the RuntimeExceptions are unchecked exceptions
*frequently faced unchecked exceptions:
     - ArithmeticException, - NullPointerException, - ArrayIndexOutBoundsException


   # checked(unwanted event): occurs during the compile time
        all the exceptions that are not RuntimeExceptions are checked exception
*frequently faced checked exceptions:
    -IO Exception   - FileNotFoundException


Exception handling:
    try and catch blocks: used for handling checked and unchecked exceptions
        try{
            exception code
        }catch(Exception Class e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        Multi-chat block: parent exception type can not be placed before the child exception type.

        finally block:
            An optional block that can be given after last catch block
            Always executed after try&catch blocks whether an exception occurs or not
            *** always get executed regardless of exception is being handled or not handled
            **to stop execution finally block is to insert System.exit(0) inside the previous catch block

     **Interview Question:
       final: keyword; unchangeable variable, class and methods
         vs
       finally (it is an optional block that can be given after last catch block)
         vs
       finalize (method, garbage collector)
