                give private access modifier to fields
                generate public getter/setters to read/write the private fields

                using the data
                writing the data

 Inheritance: Is A relation.
                parent & child classes ( super &sub)
    why? :       in order not to repeat same code fragments over and over again
    what is going to change:
            class A extend Class B
            child class (sub): inherits the variables and methods(Visible to child class) from parent class (super)
            parents class: can not inherit anything from child.

 Protected Access Modifier:
        Always visible within the same package
        Visible outside the package in subclass ONLY.
